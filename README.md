# Zoom Recording Bulk Download
Uses any Zoom accounts unique identifier (username, email, ID, etc) to download any recording from the past X amount of days.

# Purpose
There is no GUI option in Zoom for downloading all recordings associated with a user or ZoomRoom. This script downloads each file associated with the recording (transcript, audio, and video) to a folder named for the date/time of the recording, at the same directory level of the script.

It is designed to be used as a dedicated script per user or room, then run by a scheduler or manually called.
